1. Create the remote branch 

	git push origin origin:refs/heads/new_feature_name

2. Make sure everything is up-to-date 

	git fetch origin

3. Then you can see that the branch is created. 

	git branch -r

This should show ‘origin/new_feature_name’ 

4. Start tracking the new branch 

	git checkout –track -b new_feature_name origin/new_feature_name
