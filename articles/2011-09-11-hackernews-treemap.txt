title: Hackernews TreeMap Representation

A few days ago I found newsmap.jp : It's a nice way to visualize news. I decided to create the same kind of [TreeMap representation][1] but for the hackernews feed.  
This small experiment is hosted on [Heroku][2] and you can find the source on [Github][3]. It was made using [Playframework][4], InfoVis√Ç and the Hacknews Api.

It also went recursive on [hackernews ][5]!
