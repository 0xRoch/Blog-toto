title: Hackernews TreeMap Representation

A few days ago I found newsmap.jp : It's a nice way to visualize news. I decided to create the same kind of [TreeMap representation](http://www.hackrnews.com) but for the hackernews feed.  
This small experiment is hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) and you can find the source on [Github](https://github.com/D-Roch/hackrnews). It was made using [Playframework](http://www.playframework.org), InfoVis√Ç and the Hacknews Api.

It also went recursive on [hackernews ](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2982458)
