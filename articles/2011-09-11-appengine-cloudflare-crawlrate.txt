title: Google App Engine - CloudFlare and Google Bot's Crawlrate

Recently Google App Engine's team announced some big changes in their pricing.

There has been a lot of bad buzz on the newsgroup, on guy even said : [Googlebot is your Enemy][1]. Well yes, while Google is crawling your content you have to pay for servers and bandwidth but at the same time blocking Googlebot would destroy your SEO.

The fact that Google App Engine users can't manage their crawl rate in Google Webmaster Tools is wrong, and I don't really understand why they want it this way.

I wanted to see what happen if I use a round robin proxy on top of my GAE application and the result was very impressive :

Basicaly, Cloudflare was activated from June to August, then I disabled it and reactivated it in September. As you can see on the graphic, my crawl rate is way better when my app is served by a proxy.

I'm not a SEO expert, but one thing I know for sure is that when I have a high crawl rate my indexing is increasing. What's going on is not very clear to me, but it looks like GAE applications are disadvantaged.
